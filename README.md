## 🌟 Inspiration  
### Every year, thousands of accidents occur due to driver fatigue. **AI-DriveGuard** was born out of the desire to make roads safer by using technology to detect drowsiness and alert drivers in real time. This project is a step toward reducing accidents caused by fatigue and ensuring safer journeys for everyone.

## 🚀 What It Does  
**AI-DriveGuard** is an AI-powered system that:  
- Monitors the driver's eyes and face in real time.  
- Detects drowsiness and sleep using **eye aspect ratio (EAR)**.  
- Alerts the driver with sound and visual warnings.  
- Aims to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

## 💡 Why It Matters  
- **Saves Lives**: Reduces accidents caused by drowsy driving.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Provides instant warnings to keep drivers awake.  
- **AI-Powered**: Uses advanced facial landmark detection for accurate monitoring.  
---
## 🎥 How It Works  
1. Captures live video from the camera.  
2. Detect the driver's face and eyes using **Dlib's facial landmark detector**.  
3. Calculates the **eye aspect ratio (EAR)** to detect drowsiness.  
4. Triggers an alert (sound + visual warning) if drowsiness or sleep is detected.

## 📝 Future Vision  
- **Head Pose Detection**: Detect if the driver is looking away from the road.  
- **Yawning Detection**: Add yawning as an additional sign of fatigue.  
- **Mobile Integration**: Develop a mobile app for real-time monitoring.
